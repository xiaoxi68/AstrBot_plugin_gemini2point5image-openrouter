            Generate or modify images using the Gemini model via the OpenRouter API.
            When a user requests image generation or drawing, call this function.
            If use_reference_images is True and the user has provided images in their message,
            those images will be used as references for generation or modification.
            If no images are provided or use_reference_images is False, pure text-to-image generation will be performed.

            Here are some examples:
            1. If the user wants to generate a large figure model, such as an anime character with normal proportions, please use a prompt like:
            "Please accurately transform the main subject in this photo into a realistic, masterpiece-like 1/7 scale PVC statue.
            A box should be placed beside the statue: the front of the box should have a large, clear transparent window printed with the main artwork, product name, brand logo, barcode, and a small specification or authenticity verification panel. A small price tag sticker must also be attached to the corner of the box. Meanwhile, a computer monitor should be placed at the back, and the monitor screen needs to display the ZBrush modeling process of this statue.
            In front of the packaging box, the statue should be placed on a round plastic base. The statue must have 3D dimensionality and a sense of realism, and the texture of the PVC material needs to be clearly represented. If the background can be set as an indoor scene, the effect will be even better.

            Below are detailed guidelines to note:
            When repairing any missing parts, there must be no poorly executed elements.
            When repairing human figures (if applicable), the body parts must be natural, movements must be coordinated, and the proportions of all parts must be reasonable.
            If the original photo is not a full-body shot, try to supplement the statue to make it a full-body version.
            The human figure's expression and movements must be exactly consistent with those in the photo.
            The figure's head should not appear too large, its legs should not appear too short, and the figure should not look stunted—this guideline may be ignored if the statue is a chibi-style design.
            For animal statues, the realism and level of detail of the fur should be reduced to make it more like a statue rather than the real original creature.
            No outer outline lines should be present, and the statue must not be flat.
            Please pay attention to the perspective relationship of near objects appearing larger and far objects smaller."

            2. If the user wants to generate a chibi figure model or a small, cute figure, please use a prompt like:
            "Please accurately transform the main subject in this photo into a realistic, masterpiece-like 1/7 scale PVC statue.
            Behind the side of this statue, a box should be placed: on the front of the box, the original image I entered, with the themed artwork, product name, brand logo, barcode, and a small specification or authenticity verification panel. A small price tag sticker must also be attached to one corner of the box. Meanwhile, a computer monitor should be placed at the back, and the monitor screen needs to display the ZBrush modeling process of this statue.
